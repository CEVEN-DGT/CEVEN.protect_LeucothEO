Welcome to LecothEO

We want to incentivize <b>fisheries to share their data</b> on routes and catch in and around the Sargasso Sea. By <b>self-reporting their activities</b> in the area of interest, the fisheries can gain a <b>favorable rating</b> and open up a communication channel to <b>establish common ground with other stakeholders</b> in the area.
In the B2B market, buyers and sellers alike can refer to a <b>transparent, trustworthy, and controlled single source of truth</b> to prove their will to do good. Responsible buyers can sort out the responsible actors from those unwilling to act sustainably.

The Sargasso Sea is a fragile ecosystem. Due to its location, it is hard to monitor, hard to protect, but essential to understanding more about the dynamics of human-nature interaction. A dramatic increase in fishing vessels in the Sargasso Sea's eastern part within less than ten years made observers curious of the ships' activities in the area. We shine a light on that stage!

<i>We regard the UN SDG as a holistic, interlocked system of dependencies. Nevertheless, we focus on Goal 14, "Life Below Water," as our main incentive to develop our solution.
We encourage responsible, sustainable, and inclusive behavior by providing incentives, transparency, and communication channels between stakeholders in the Sargasso Sea ecosystem.</i>
